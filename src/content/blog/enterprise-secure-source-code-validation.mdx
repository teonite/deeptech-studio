Blockchain as a technology is here to stay and is [being widely adopted](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-07/jpmorgan-jpm-explores-blockchain-deposit-token-for-payment-settlement?ref=teonite.com). But from technology to solutions there is a long road (especially for enterprise solutions).

Making blockchain more accessible and prepared for enterprises is one of [Casper Network](https://casper.network/?ref=teonite.com)'s missions - and one of the core challenges in that area is to provide a secure source code (of decentralized applications) for validation and exploration.

We have formed a **strategic partnership with Casper Network to deliver a service that will not only provide network deployments source code validation but will deliver enterprise-grade security standards** (including secure architecture, Hardware Security Modules, and others).

> The source code validation is a critical component of every blockchain in 
> order to intruduce trust layer into any decentralized applications, 
> especially with the real value locked-in. We are very happy that teonite
> took the challenge of delivering this solution and welcome a new 
> partner to the Casper ecosystem!

Milestone #1 was already delivered and presented during the last Casper Dev Meetup in Wrocław.

> We didn’t expect to see results on this project that quick, especially in 
> the critical path of recreating WASM Rust deployments, so kudos to 
> teonite and we are glad to have them as a partner.

Stay tuned for more information about the service soon, as the work 
progresses – especially since we plan to make significant components of 
the service #**opensource** (and plan to incorporate in the service our [open-source security platform defguard](https://github.com/defguard/defguard/?ref=teonite.com)).
