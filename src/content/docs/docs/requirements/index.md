## Discovery

> “A problem defined is a problem half solved”  
> — Albert Einstein

The goal of the Discovery Phase is to set the product development on course to success by defining project goals, objectives, and stakeholders' expectations.

#### Why is this phase important?

Information gathered during this phase impacts product design, architecture, and development & management style. It helps in acquiring realistic project costs from potential technology providers. This phase is required before making any cost forecasts.

A series of 2-3 meetings (at least one in person) with key project stakeholders, focused on building a high-level 360° view of the project context. This usually takes a few days to complete, depending on project scope and domain complexity.

#### Results
The gathered information is documented in the form of a short high-level specification of the product. After this step, you will receive a document called Project Brief with:

- Project stakeholders
- High-level business goals
- Product/system actors description
- System boundaries and responsibilities
- Risk factors
- Project size assessment (cost category)
- Crew composition models for various scenarios

#### Recommended Next Steps
- Start Product Design - conduct detailed system analysis and design to make the estimation more accurate
- Start the Product Development in parallel with the Product Design phase
- Do a POC first to see if the risky areas are a threat
- Limit the scope of the product to adjust the cost to meet budget expectations

---

## Design

Purpose
The goal of the design phase is to create a specification, a blueprint for the product so the development team has clear guidelines for the product's look and behavior.

Results
At the completion of the design phase, you will receive a document with:

- User stories
- User flows and key business processes
- Low-fi UI design / UI wireframes
- System architecture (physical/logical/technologies)
- Risk analysis
- Roadmap with MVP and milestones set
- Cost estimation on user stories level
- Project costs forecasts
- Development team composition proposal

#### Form
Series of interviews and refinements organized in weekly sprints, engaging people with the most knowledge about the product domain. The agenda usually covers story mapping, live UI/UX wireframe design, problem-solving discussions, and client tech department consultations.

#### Benefits
- Saves time during development by providing detailed guidelines about functionalities, interface, and architecture
- More accurate cost estimation
- Provides a framework for monitoring system costs in the form of a project roadmap

#### How Does it Work?
We establish your specification goals, which may include:

- Realistic project planning (creating an initial project roadmap)
- Resource allocation
- Realistic cost planning and future tracking
- Early risk identification and elimination

The scope of our effort for each stage is negotiable, depending on the materials and information you can provide upfront and the expected level of details we agree on. The design process is non-linear, following the discovery path orchestrated by experienced analysts, and generally consists of the stages and logic described below.

---

## Kickoff

The process starts with a kickoff meeting where we:

- Establish, discuss, and confirm specification goals and purpose
- Introduce our crew that will participate in the specification development
- Define the level of detail for the specification (e.g., depth of use case/user stories description, UI/UX wireframes detail level)
- Appoint a Product Owner - a member of your team representing users' interests
- Orchestrate a discussion about available resources (documentation, systems, briefs, points of contact)
- Plan the results and scope for the first sprint and checkpoints

After the kickoff, we continue with analysis within the agreed scope and boundaries.

---

## Background Assessment

Our first task is to assess what is already known by you and your team and what elements must be created in the process. We analyze provided materials in detail, which may include:

- Requirements lists
- UI/UX designs
- Briefs
- Legacy applications
- Reference systems, etc.
- Specifications

The goal is to assess what information we can incorporate into the final specification document. We explain what artifacts should be developed to reach specification DoD. This stage usually takes 1 to 3 days to complete.

### Result
You receive a specification backlog - the initial scope of our analytical and design work.

---

## Analysis (User Story Mapping)

This aspect of the design process typically starts with a requirements list, project brief, Product Owner review, or workshops. We use an analysis method based on actors, processes, views, and business entities, which produces a list of requirements in the form of User Stories. One technique we use to define user-facing aspects of the system is User Story Mapping.

### Example User Story
“As an operator (actor) I can conclude an auction (process) in the auction administration panel (view) so that all bids (entity) are closed with either won or lost status.”

### Results
Artifacts created at this stage include:

- Description of actors and responsibilities
- Documentation of all identified User Stories (US) in the form of an initial Product Backlog
- Documentation of mapped processes
- Data flows (sequence diagrams)
- Algorithms (block diagrams)
- APIs Specification (optional)
- Business entities list (optional)

### Duration
This stage may involve multiple sprints (weeks) and online or stationary workshops, mixed with documentation and synthesis of collected information.

---

## UI/UX Analysis and Design

### Purpose
UI design has several goals:

- Save time and enable communication between the Product Owner and the development crew
- Test ideas and concepts before they are coded
- Test user stories by simulating user behavior
- Enable more accurate estimation as the dev crew can estimate based on groups of functionalities and views

### Form
This stage takes the form of interactive workshops focused on providing simplified views called Wireframes and visualizing processes like a user journey from each actor's perspective.

### Results
- System Wireframes provided in AdobeXD or Figma
- User Flow diagrams provided in Miro

### Duration
The duration depends on the number of system views and their complexity discovered during requirements analysis. Sometimes it is possible to estimate the rough number of views and complexity during the assessment stage.

---

## Architecture Blueprint

The architecture part of the specification explains how the system will be implemented. It includes:

- Selected/recommended technology stack: provisioning, languages, libraries, and frameworks
- Description of logical system components (e.g., databases, message queues, mailing services, logging infrastructure, authentication components)
- Diagram of logical architecture in C4 model
- Physical architecture - specification of the physical components on which the logical architecture will be implemented (e.g., on-premise, cloud components, etc.)

Note: The architecture blueprint is not a complete architecture specification; it contains only coarse guidelines necessary for the development crew to assess the complexity and time effort of development.

## Security Aspects

Teonite security standards are described in the following document:

---

## Risk Analysis

Risk analysis aspects are presented throughout the entire cycle of building solutions. Our focus is mainly on technological risks that are ever-present in deep tech projects. Risks are identified and collected during:

- Requirements specification
- Roadmap planning
- Architecture design

### Risk Areas
We focus on identifying risks in the following areas:

- Technology feasibility
- Performance & SLA
- Business - project timeline & budget, third parties involvement
- Legal & regulatory
- Security

All identified risks are documented and discussed with stakeholders. We make recommendations on mitigating and minimizing risks or designing system elements that increase resilience toward risk.

---

## Roadmap Planning

Planning is possible after previous stages have been completed (or at least are in an advanced stage). During planning, we do the following:

- Estimation of defined User Stories, UI, and processes
- Identify main chunks of work (Epics forming)
- Propose a development crew composition
- Propose the order of implementation, including milestones set in time

### Notes
The roadmap is the first step toward project kickoff, so it’s optimal to prepare it in project management software like Jira, which allows for easy breakdown of large (Epic stories) chunks of work into smaller User Stories and visualizing them on a Gantt chart (The Roadmap).

---

## Project Budget Forecasting

Having completed all stages of the Specification and Design process, we provide forecasts of potential project costs in the form of a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). This forecast is unique because it is based on:

- Our crew's compounded experience
-

 The empirical velocity measured during other projects
- The full-stack development approach

Our estimations consider the Definition of Done (DoD), which defines what it means for the work to be completed. Each project has its own individual DoD, both on the User Story level and on the Sprint level.

Our estimations also include elements of the Scrum process, which we mostly use as a development framework: sprint planning, review meetings, backlog grooming meetings, and retrospectives.

### Note
Complex projects cannot be planned with 100% accuracy. Unexpected obstacles, external provider delays, human factors, and changing requirements should be assumed. The budget should allow compensation for these factors. Additionally, time and complexity estimates are unique to our crew. Other companies and teams might use different techniques for estimating.

## Appendix

### Specification DoD and Acceptance Criteria

- The specification is a contract between the Product Owner and the development team and must be clear and readable for both parties.
- One goal of the specification is to allow the team to estimate (at a high level) the amount of effort required to deliver the system.
- Requirement documentation should be written in the form of User Stories (so that it’s convertible into a Product Backlog) and meet quality standards like INVEST: Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable.
- The specification contains an architecture description enabling developers to assess the work effort and time necessary to code stories.
