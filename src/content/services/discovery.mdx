## Discovery

During the Discovery phase we define project objectives, stakeholders expectations and identify risks. After 2-3 daily workshops you will receive Project Brief documenting your solution in a professional way.
<Divider />
Why is this phase important?

Information gathered during this phase has an impact on product design, architecture, and development & management style. From your perspective (as a product owner) itâ€™s beneficial to have this information written down to acquire realistic project costs from potential technology providers.

### Form

A series of 2-3 meetings (at least on in person) with key project stakeholders, focused on building a high-level 360 view of the project context.

It usually takes a few days to 2-3 weeks to complete (depending on the project scope and domain complexity). We provide estimates of the process.

### Results

The gathered information is documented in the form of a short high-level specification of the product. After this step, you will receive a document called Project Brief with the specified:

- high-level business goals
- product/system actors description
- system boundaries and responsibilities
- risk factors
- project size assessment (cost category)
- crew composition models for various scenarios

Recommended next steps:

- start Product Design - conduct detailed system analysis and design to make the estimation more accurate
- start the Product Development in parallel with the Product Design phase
- do a POC first to see if the risky areas are a threat
- limit the scope of the product to adjust the cost to meet budget expectations

## DESIGN

The goal of the design phase is to create a specification, a blueprint for the product so that the development team has clear guidelines for the product's look and behavior.

At the completion of the design phase, you will receive a document with the specified:

- user stories
- user flows and key business processes
- low-fi UI design / UI wireframes
- system architecture (physical/logical / technologies)
- risk analysis
- roadmap with MVP and milestones set
- cost estimation on user stories level
- project costs forecasts
- development team composition proposal

### Form

Series of interviews and refinements organized in weekly sprints, engaging people with the greatest knowledge about the product domain.

The agenda usually covers story mapping, live UI/UX wireframe design, problem-solving discussions, and tech department consultations.
