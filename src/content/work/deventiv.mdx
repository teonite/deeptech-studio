### What is Medisensonic?
MediSensonic, a leading Med-Tech and Deep-Tech technology company relied on teonite expertise to research & develop AI based algorithms for creation of high-precision 3D model of the mouth.


### Results

Research and development of AI based 3D model reconstruction algorithms for medical scanning device.

A) Our multidisciplinary R&D crew combined skills in AI, 3D modelling and scientific research to train and fine tune selected Neural Networks to recreate high precision 3D representation of objects based on custom optical setup. 

AI based 3D modelling selected Neural Networks for a very specific problem of creating high precision 3D representation of objects based on custom optical setup.
