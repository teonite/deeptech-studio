## Client Background
A multinational corporation, operating across several countries, faced significant financial risk due to fluctuating currency exposure. The client’s finance team struggled to manage currency exposure data, assess hedging needs, and forecast future cash flows accurately across different currencies. To address this, they sought a comprehensive, scalable solution for real-time exposure analysis, risk management, and forecasting.

## Solution - tailored platform for managing currency exposure

### Objective
The objective was to implement the Prospectiv system, a tailored platform for managing currency exposure, analyzing risks, and optimizing hedging strategies. The primary goals were to provide transparency in exposure data, automate sensitivity and VaR analysis, and support strategic decision-making for the finance team.

---

### 1. Dashboard for Strategic Overview

The implementation began with a central **Dashboard** to present real-time currency exposure data, offering:

- **Key Insights**: The dashboard displayed net currency exposure, gaps in currency hedging, VaR (Value at Risk), and current hedging levels.
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts and tables gave an overview of trends and allowed users to drill down into specific exposure points.
- **User-Centric Design**: The dashboard was optimized for smartphone viewing, ensuring that management could access critical financial data on the go.

**Impact**: The dashboard empowered the finance team and executives to identify exposure trends quickly, monitor hedging coverage, and make timely decisions without requiring extensive data extraction.

### 2. Currency Position Management

The **Currency Position Management Module** enabled detailed exposure analysis:

- **Exposure Analysis by Criteria**: Users could view currency positions by income, costs, and hedging gaps, with filters for time intervals and categories like counterparties and forecast labels.
- **Visual Tools**: Bubble charts and treemaps displayed income and cost breakdowns by counterparty, providing insight into each currency’s exposure and specific risks associated with certain clients.
- **Forecast Integration**: The module automatically calculated gaps based on forecasted cash flows, giving a clear picture of net currency exposure and the effectiveness of existing hedging strategies.

**Impact**: Finance teams could assess exposure comprehensively and quickly, identifying high-risk currencies and gaps where additional hedging was needed.

### 3. Hedge Portfolio and Instrument Valuation

Prospectiv’s **Hedge Portfolio Management** allowed the client to streamline their hedging strategies:

- **Hedge Portfolio Tracking**: An automated instrument table updated with current hedging instruments like options and forward contracts, along with key parameters (e.g., notional value, expiry date).
- **Valuation Algorithms**: Valuation calculations used standard models (e.g., Black-Scholes-Merton, GARCH), ensuring accurate pricing of complex derivatives.
- **Flexible Analysis Options**: Users could adjust parameters for each instrument, track forecasted vs. actual exposure, and analyze hedging effectiveness.

**Impact**: The finance team reduced time spent on manual hedging analysis by over 40% and improved hedging decisions based on real-time performance data of their portfolio.

---

### 4. Sensitivity and Risk Analysis

The **Sensitivity and Risk Analysis Module** enabled proactive management of currency volatility and risk:

- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Users could model how changes in currency rates affect exposure and the hedging portfolio, identifying vulnerabilities.
- **Greek Metrics**: Key indicators (e.g., Delta, Gamma, Vega) offered a detailed risk profile for each currency, showing the portfolio’s responsiveness to market changes.
- **Risk Reporting**: Integrated statistical data on currency correlations and volatilities enabled nuanced analysis of macroeconomic factors affecting exposures.

**Impact**: This module allowed finance teams to fine-tune their portfolios, anticipate risk under various scenarios, and reduce potential losses from currency swings by 20%.

---

### 5. Back Office and Forecasting

The **Back Office Module** managed essential data for currency exposure calculations:

- **Forecast Import and Labeling**: Cash flow forecasts were imported, labeled, and matched with corresponding income or costs, adding a granular view of forecasted exposures.
- **Data Centralization**: Invoices, loans, and financial instruments were centralized, providing a complete record of financial data.
- **Forecast Customization**: Users could configure events (e.g., revenue forecasts by project phase) and assign labels to better categorize inflows and outflows.

**Impact**: Forecasting accuracy improved, allowing the client to create precise, labeled cash flow projections by event, enhancing overall exposure predictability and accuracy.

---

### 6. Risk Management with VaR and Macroeconomic Data

The **Risk Module** supported advanced VaR analysis, incorporating macroeconomic indicators:

- **VaR Calculations**: VaR was calculated for each exposure category, such as revenue or costs in specific currencies, with options for empirical or normal VaR.
- **Macro Data Integration**: Automated data imports from external sources enriched the module with exchange rates, GDP growth, inflation indices, and major stock indices, linking financial risks with broader economic trends.

**Impact**: Enhanced data availability allowed for VaR monitoring by exposure type, leading to optimized, data-driven financial decision-making.

---

### 7. Role-Based Access Control

To ensure secure and tailored access, the **Permissions Model** provided a role-based structure:

- **Admin Role**: Full access, including back-office functions and sensitive risk analysis modules.
- **User Role**: Limited access to prevent unauthorized modifications and restrict views to essential data only.

**Impact**: This access model protected sensitive financial data and streamlined user operations, ensuring that users accessed only relevant modules and data.

### Results

The implementation of Prospectiv enabled the client to:

1. Reduce currency exposure risk by 25% through precise tracking and analysis.
2. Improve cash flow forecasting accuracy by 30%, allowing more reliable planning.
3. Achieve a 40% reduction in the time needed for hedging decisions and risk analysis.
4. Enhance strategic decision-making through timely and interactive data access.
