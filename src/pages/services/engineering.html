                  Always based on the results of the discovery and design phase

              <h2>What are the key elements of the process?</h2>
              <h3>Kickoff</h3>
              <p>
                During the kick-off meeting, you’ll have a chance to meet the
                development team members. The meeting is all about figuring out
                who is responsible for what and how we are going to communicate
                (when and using what kind of channels). We basically create a
                “contract“ between the client and the development team that
                explains what can be expected of us.
              </p>
              <h3>Roadmap</h3>
              <p>
                This element is very useful for planning the work as well as
                monitoring the progress and the budget. The scope of the whole
                project is roughly divided into independent chunks (also called
                epics).
              </p>
              <p>
                After each chunk has a known priority and effort it can be
                placed on a time schedule. While placing it there we take into
                consideration what is your desired time of delivery, what should
                be the team size, which chunks can be done in parallel, which
                are the most risky and should be attacked first, and what are
                the main checkpoints (milestones).
              </p>
              <p>
                When done right the roadmap can be then used for planning the
                tasks for the team and checking where we stand with the progress
                vs. the budget.
              </p>
              <h3>Sprints</h3>
              <p>
                A series of week-long sprints. Think of a sprint as a mini
                project, meaning the scope and the end result are known, the
                result must be useful to the client even if it’s small.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each sprint involves planning the work for this week (mostly
                picking from the roadmap), thinking in detail about the tasks
                that come next, delivering the result and presenting it to the
                client. The scope of a sprint is always aligned with the project
                roadmap. After each sprint roadmap gets updated and checked if
                it still reflects reality. The initial plan and process might
                change as we face obstacles but it’s easier to handle them when
                you know about them as soon as possible. This rhythm and routine
                leaves very little space for chaos and works as a well-oiled
                machine.
              </p>
              <p>
                This methodology is result-oriented. After each sprint, the
                client receives a useful software increment. Something that you
                can see for yourself and is already useful or makes you sure you
                are one step further into achieving the final goal. For a
                complete package, the software is also backed by new
                documentation and test results.
              </p>
              <h3>Maintenance or hand-off</h3>
              <p>
                After the team is done with implementing all the planned
                functionalities and the solution is deployed to the production
                environment it’s time to decide how you want to handle the
                product in the future.
              </p>
              <p>
                You might have an in-house maintenance team that will handle the
                support process. In that case, we can carry out an overtaking
                workshop to transfer all our knowledge to the new team. We do
                that by giving them detailed documentation about the project,
                presenting the development process, presenting the code, and
                giving access to all the required environments.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you don’t have your own maintenance team we can provide you
                with one. We make sure that the team gets all the knowledge to
                support you. We also always have at least one member of the
                development team in the support team. We can also pick all the
                tools required for the effective maintenance of your product.
              </p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h2>What do you need to do to maximize success?</h2>
              <p>
                It is very important that the client (or his/her representative)
                is actively involved in the process. Only then we can be sure
                that the end result is what you intended it to be. We call the
                person involved a Product Owner (PO).
              </p>
              <p>
                The PO should be present while planning the roadmap, planning
                the work for a sprint, reviewing sprint results and analysing
                the tasks in detail. This basically means that every business
                decision gets consulted with the client representative, with no
                surprises.
              </p>
              <p>
                The PO is also informed about the progress and the budget
                consumption level. Requirements change and some risks
                materialise. This all affects the scope of the project. PO
                should be aware of that for full transparency.
              </p>
