              <h2>Client Challange</h2>
              <p>
                As one of the largest mobile network operators in Poland with
                over 10 million customers, T-Mobile Poland possesses a
                substantial volume of data often referred to as 'Big Data.' What
                sets T-Mobile apart is its conscious approach to the value of
                this data, which prompted our collaborative project. T-Mobile
                actively sought ways to leverage this data to optimize business
                processes, particularly in the realm of product and service
                sales.
              </p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h2>Solution</h2>
              <p>
                To address this challenge, we proposed a data analysis and
                predictive modeling system based on Machine Learning. The
                analytical system consisted of several key components:
              </p>
              <h2>Security</h2>
              <p>
                The first crucial step involved establishing a secure
                environment for working with sensitive data. Our DevOps team
                created a solution based on VPN tunnels and multiple layers of
                authorization, enabling remote work with sensitive data from
                T-Mobile's data warehouse.
              </p>
              <h2>Data Preparation (Data Engineering)</h2>
              <p>
                The next step involved the preparation and analysis of the
                accessible data. The data stored in the Hadoop system required
                proper aggregation and preselection based on relevant attributes
                pertinent to the problem. This process involved collaboration
                between T-Mobile's Big Data team and teonite’s Data Science
                team.
              </p>
              <h2>Data Analysis / Feature Selection</h2>
              <p>
                With the prepared data, we conducted analyses that included the
                visualization of attributes, correlation analysis, determination
                of quality and resolution, and metric development. This phase
                allowed us to identify issues related to data quality and
                modeling assumptions. One such challenge was the excessive depth
                of aggregation, resulting in numerous missing values. Through
                experimentation, we found an appropriate level of aggregation to
                create a dataset suitable for machine learning modeling.
              </p>
              <h2>Predictive Modeling</h2>
              <p>
                We implemented and tested various versions of the model,
                utilizing Jupyter Notebook within the TMPL infrastructure.
                Regression algorithms, including Lasso, ElasticNet, Ridge
                Regression, and Gradient Boosting, were tested. The final model
                implementation employed the XGBoost algorithm in Python, known
                for its "boosting" approach using a tree ensemble.
              </p>
              <h2>Presentation of Results</h2>
              <p>
                The final and vital aspect of the project was presenting the
                research findings in a business-friendly format. We employed
                various tools for this purpose, including interactive model
                deployment (Jupyter Notebooks), visualization using interactive
                maps with integrated information (Google Maps), and an
                interactive environment for result analysis (Orange Data
                Studio).

              <h2>Challenges</h2>
              <h2>Legal and Regulatory Considerations</h2>
              <p>
                Adherence to data privacy regulations and anonymization of
                personal data were imperative due to legal restrictions
                governing data use.
              </p>
              <h2>Data Quality</h2>
              <p>
                Ensuring the quality of data related to subscriber counts and
                traffic intensity in specific areas required selecting
                representative measurement points and data transformation.
              </p>
              <h2>Feature Engineering</h2>
              <p>
                Addressing the lack of strong correlations between the target
                variable (new contracts signed in stores) and explanatory
                variables, along with limitations affecting the model's ability
                to differentiate predicted locations, was a key challenge.
