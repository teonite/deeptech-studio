              <p>
                We’re very happy to announce that our cooperation with
                <a href="http://castlabs.com/company/about/" target="_blank"
                  >castLabs</a
                >
                in the development of backend systems for the UltraViolet
                ecosystem, has completed and can be considered successful. Below
                we outline the project’s objectives and the project’s importance
                for the usability of UltraViolet.

              <h2>What is UltraViolet?</h2>
              <p>
                In short, UltraViolet is a cloud-based digital rights storage
                system, enabling consumers to access their purchased content
                across all devices using many different services. UltraViolet
                was first announced in 2010 by DECE (Digital Entertainment
                Content Ecosystem), a huge consortium composed of major film
                studios, e.g. Universal Studios, Sony Entertainment Pictures,
                Warner Bros. Entertainment, Internet-based companies and ISPs,
                retailers, cable TV companies, network hosting vendors and many
                more.

              <h2>UltraViolet from user perspective</h2>
              <p>
                Every time you get a copy of a DVD or Blue-ray Disc
                distributed/produced by one of the DECE partners and labeled
                with the UltraViolet mark you can easily add your new title to
                your UltraViolet Library by redeeming a code that comes with
                each copy. This gives you unlimited access to your movies
                throughout different devices and platforms. Pretty neat. You can
                also directly buy digital versions of movies and TV shows from
                UltraViolet participating services.
              </p>

              <h2>What was the project all about</h2>
              <p>
                We took an active role working with castLabs development team
                **in building a totally new version of DECE’s UltraViolet
                Coordinator service** — the cloud-based servers, databases, and
                web services API - ensuring fast and error-free communication
                between UltraViolet ecosystem and various retailers and content
                publishers.
              </p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h2>Results</h2>
              <p>
                The service ran smoothly during December holiday peak and no
                major issues were reported which, considering the sheer numbers
                involved, makes it a great success. UltraViolet has over 28
                million users with over 250 million movies and TV shows in 13
                countries. During holidays (24th/25th) the number of API calls
                peaked at 1M per hour, and **on New Year’s Eve it rose up to
                1,7M transactions per hour.** And everything worked just fine.
                If that’s not a success, I don’t know what is.

              <h2>Aftermath</h2>
              <p>
                The project has ended successfully. We like to treat the sheer
                scale of this undertaking as a good proof of our capabilities
                and high skill level, but we’ll happily accept even more
                challenging project anytime.
              </p>
              <p>
                A good thing that comes from such joint projects is the
                possibility to work in a new environment and with new developers
                which is very motivating, especially when you see they know what
                they’re doing. All in all, we certainly hope for further
                cooperation with castLabs.
              </p>
